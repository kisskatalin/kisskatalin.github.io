    <h2>Last.fm</h2>

    <p>Last.fm is a music website that provides you to scrobble tracks from music services where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view your personal songs, artists, albums.</p>

    <h3>Problem Overview</h3>

    I was interested in redesigning the current mobile application which got negative reviews from the users: it has an average 2.8 score from 78,555 users (as of April 2021) on Google Play, the most reviewers gave it 1.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    I asked 5 participants to find out what they need and how they use the mobile application. 65 participants answered about what they use on Last.fm through survey. All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.
 
    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    The users feel frustrated because the app doesnâ€™t offer the same features as the website does. The content of data is limited which often navigates them to see more content on the website. The current mobile application is only good for checking out if the scrobbles were collected or not.

    <h3>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h3>
