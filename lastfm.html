    <h2>Last.fm</h2>

    <p>Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    The Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to see and edit their data on the website.

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    With its upgraded design, the Last.fm mobile application gives you the same experience as the website does. Through the mobile application, you can not only scrobble your songs but edit your scrobbles, visit the pages of artists, songs and albums, check out your listening history, see what your friends like listening to.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Five participants</span> were interviewed about what they use and what they like or dislike on the mobile application. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Sixty-five participants</span> filled out a survey about what they use on Last.fm. All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.
 
    <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

    I wanted to learn about how the users use the mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between the website and the mobile application.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    The users feel frustrated because the application doesnâ€™t allow them to edit their scrobbles. According to them, it's only good for checking out if the scrobbles were collected or not.
    The users rarely use Last.fm for discovery because they rather check out the recommendations what the music services, where they listen to the songs, offer them.
    The users don't use the message feature at all, but they like to see what their friends' are listening to.

    <h3>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h3>

    <h4>Affinity map from the user research (from 5 user interviews)</h4>

    <h4>Research finding applied to the design</h4>

    One of the key findings in this project was that the users are missing the function to edit/delete their scrobbles because they always have to open the website to do so.

    <h4>Iteration from adding the scrobble to deleting it</h4>
