    <h2>Last.fm Redesign</h2>

    <p>Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    The Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to their website.

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    The upgraded design of the Last.fm mobile application has the same features that are only available on the website now. Compared to the website, the redesigned mobile application is easier to use as it contains all the important functions that the users missed while the interface got less complex.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    I wanted to learn about how the users use the mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between the website and the current mobile application.

    <h4>Research questions</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Do they use Last.fm frequently?</li>
        <li>Do they use Last.fm for a long time?</li>
        <li>How do they use the current mobile application?</li>
        <li>How satisfied are they while using the current mobile application?</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

    <b>Participants</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Users who use Last.fm for years</li>
        <li>Users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">6 participants</span> were interviewed about what they use and what they like or dislike about the current mobile application. <span style="font-weight: bold;">65 participants</span> filled out a survey about what they use on Last.fm. All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.

    In-person semi-structured interview questions:

    <ol>
        <li>Which services do you use to scrobble music? (What services are the users comfortable with to connect with Last.fm?)</li>
        <li>How do you decide what to listen to? (Where do they discover music?)</li>
        <li>Why did you get started using Last.fm? (What motivated them to sign up?)</li>
        <li>When was the last time you opened up Last.fm? (How often do the users use Last.fm?)</li>
        <li>Do you use the mobile application or the website more often? Why? (Do the users prefer the mobile application or the website of Last.fm?)</li>
        <li>How often do you check out the reports/statistics of your listening history? (How often do they use this feature?)</li>
        <li>Which timeframe do you check out the most often? (Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</li>
        <li>Which section do you check out the most often? (Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</li>
        <li>Besides checking out your scrobbles, do you use Last.fm for anything else? (e.g. for discovering new music, checking out events, visiting the artist’s page, etc.) (Which features do they use?)</li>
        <li>What do you like about the mobile application? (What is the strength of the mobile application?)</li>
        <li>What do you dislike about the mobile application? (What is the weakness of the mobile application?)</li>
        <li>If you were to add something to Last.fm, what will it be? (What do they wish from the mobile application?)</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    <h4>Affinity map from the user research (from 6 user interviews)</h4>

    <img src="/pic/lastfm/affinitymap.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

    <h4>Key findings based on the users' needs:</h4>

    <p>1) The participants prefer the website over the mobile application</p>
    They find the mobile application limited compared to the website.
    <br>“I miss the edit function for the scrobbles, so I still have to go the website if i want to change some tags.”
    <br>“I miss a better and longer overview of the listening history.”
    <br>“The settings are very limited. It literally just gives you the option to turn off scrobbling.”

    <p>2) The participants are curious about what others are listening to:</p>
    “I want to see what the friends listen to.”
    <br>“I listen to music what I like and what others enjoy.”
    <br>“On the website, I like to check out other members' profiles.”

    <p>3) The 30% of the participants are Last.fm Pro members</p>
