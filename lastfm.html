    <h2>Last.fm</h2>

    <p>Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    The Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to see and edit their data on the website.

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    With its upgraded design, the Last.fm mobile application has the similar features that the website has but in improved version. Through the mobile application, you can not only scrobble your songs but edit your scrobbles, visit the pages of artists, songs and albums, check out your listening history, see what your friends like listening to. Compared to the website, the redesigned mobile application got easier to use as the interface became less complex.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    I wanted to learn about how the users use the mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between the website and the mobile application.
 
    <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

    <b>Participants</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Users who use Last.fm for years</li>
        <li>Users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Five participants</span> were interviewed about what they use and what they like or dislike on the mobile application. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sixty-five participants</span> filled out a survey about what they use on Last.fm. All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    <h4>Affinity map from the user research (from 5 user interviews)</h4>

    <img src="/pic/lastfm/affinitymap.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

    Key findings based on the users' needs:

    <p>1) The participants prefer the website over the mobile application</p>
    They find the mobile application limited compared to the website.
    <br>“I miss the edit function for the scrobbles, so I still have to go the website if i want to change some tags.”
    <br>“I miss a better and longer overview of the listening history.”
    <br>“The settings are very limited. It literally just gives you the option to turn off scrobbling.”

    <p>2) The participants are curious about what others are listening to:</p>
    “I want to see what the friends listen to.”
    <br>“I listen to music what I like and what others enjoy.”
    <br>“On the website, I like to check out other members' profiles.”

    <h3>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h3>
