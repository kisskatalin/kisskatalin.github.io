    <h2>Mastercard<sup>Â®</sup> Billpay</h2>

    <p>The project was made for UI Academy course.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    In Hungary, a huge amouth of bills are paid through yellow checks at the post offices every year while the online payment is also there. 

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    There isn't any aggregator application on the market, so Mastercard builds on the existing Bill Pay Exchange and releases Billpay.

It also provides the possibility of recurring payments with a debit card or a bank account.

    <h3>Target audience</h3>

    45+ year-old women who don't trust online banking, that's why they prefer to pay the bills through checks.

    <br><br>While working as a front-end web developer, I watched this audience and got to know them better. I even made some researches then that I could re-use in this project.

    <br><br>The client wanted a simple layout for the application. According to their research, the target audience uses basic mobile applications (email, browser, Facebook and Viber), so knowing that fact, my main point was to make it clear with a limited color range. Also, showing the brand on the screens would put the user in the comfort zone.
