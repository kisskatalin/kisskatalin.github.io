    <h2>Mastercard<sup>Â®</sup> Billpay</h2>

    <header style="background-image:url(../pic/billpay.png);"></header>

    <p>The project was made for UI Academy course.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

    In Hungary, a huge amount of bills are paid through yellow checks at the post offices every year while the online payment is also there. There isn't any aggregator application on the market. Service providers could use their own channel, but it would have maintenance and development costs while the customers would meet different user interfaces all the time when they pay their bills to each provider which may reduce the customer experience.

    <h3>Solution</h3>

    Mastercard builds on the existing Bill Pay Exchange and releases Billpay. The application is available to all the service providers in Hungary and also provides the possibility of recurring payments with a debit card or a bank account.

    <h3>Target audience</h3>

    45+ year-old women who don't trust online banking, that's why they prefer to pay with cash.

    <h3>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h3>

    The low-fidelity wireframe was given by UI Academy. Based on that, I started sketching my ideas for the high-fidelity wireframe.

    <h4>Sketch</h4>



    <br><br>While working as a front-end web developer, I watched this audience and got to know them better, so I could re-use my findings in this project.

    <br><br>The client wanted a simple layout for the application. According to their research, the target audience uses basic mobile applications (email, browser, Facebook and Viber), so knowing that, my main aspect with regard to this info was to make the interface clear. Also, putting the user in the comfort zone was important because these users, who are not comfortable with smartphones, could easily give up on this application when they face any problem. 

    <h3>Solution & Impact Overview</h3>

    The interface was designed based on the official Mastercard design book. Orange was chosen as the primary color which symbolizes the brand logo pretty well, so do the inputs and buttons with rounded corners.
