        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <p>In Hungary, a huge amount of bills are paid through yellow checks at post offices every year while the online payment is also there. There isn't any aggregator application on the market. Service providers could use their own channel, but it would be maintenance and development costs while the customers would see different user interfaces all the time when they pay their bills to each provider which would reduce the customer experience as a whole.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>

        <p>Mastercard builds on the existing Bill Pay Exchange and releases Billpay. The application is available to all the service providers in Hungary to reach their customer base. The customers can pay their bills through the mobile application which also provides the possibility of recurring payments with a debit card or a bank account.</p>

        <h3>Target audience</h3>

        <p>People who want to keep all their payments in one place. However, many of them do not trust banks enough to stop using yellow checks.
        <br>The target audience can be better presented through a persona.</p>

        <h4>Persona</h4>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marika (54)</span>
            <br>Marika works as a cashier at a supermarket in Szeged. She's busy at work on weekdays, so she has time to go to the post office to pay the bills on Saturday mornings. When her monthly salary arrives, she withdraws money from the ATM as soon as possible. She prefers cash and only pays with card when she spends a larger amouth or doesn't have enough money in her wallet. Marika owns a smartphone and likes to communicate with it as her most used applications are Facebook, Viber, browser and email.
        </p>

        <h3>Design: Concepts</h3>

        <p>My main goal with the design was to leave the user in the comfort zone. Since this group is not the most familiar with modern technology and their trust in banks are very uncertain, I wanted to create a simple and clear user interface with a few but necessary colors that keep them focused.</p>

        <h3>Solution & Impact Overview</h3>

        <p>The interface was designed based on the official Mastercard design book. Mastercard has a well-known trademark and probably looks familiar to the target group, so their trust could be won primarily by the brand itself. That's why orange was chosen as the primary color which represents the brand pretty well, so do the inputs, checkboxes and buttons with rounded corners. I also added the logo to the upper right corner of the screens to confirm the affiliation with the brand.</p>

        <p>The video below is of an iteration from searching for a service through adding it to the account to paying the bills.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The final product was tested with two users from the target group. They immediately understood the application which was easy to use. Seemingly, they found it safe as Mastercard is a reliable service in their opinion.</p>
