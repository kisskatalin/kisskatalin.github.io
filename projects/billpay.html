                   Billpay is a mobile application available to all the service providers in Hungary to reach their customer base. You can pay your bills via mobile and can make recurring payments with debit card or bank account.

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">In Hungary, a huge amount of bills are paid through yellow checks at post offices every year while the online payment has been available for over a decade. There isn't any aggregator application on the market.</p> 
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Service providers could use their own channel, but it would have maintenance and development costs while the customers would see different user interfaces all the time when they pay their bills to each provider. This would reduce the customer experience as a whole.</p>

She always pays with cash, only uses her debit card when she spends a larger amouth or doesn't have enough money in her wallet.

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Since this group is not the most familiar with modern technology and their trust in banks are very uncertain, I wanted to create a simple user interface with a few but necessary colors that keep them focused.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">In the final prototype, they could complete all the tasks that I asked for, like searching for and adding a service to the app, completing a bill payment, scanning the QR code from a check.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">The users liked that the app tries to be loyal to the brand which meant safety for them in the sense that they weren't afraid to add their debit cards to the app.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Overall, the app gives the opportunity to reduce the number of the physical check payments.</p>
