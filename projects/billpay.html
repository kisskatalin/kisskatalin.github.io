                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

                <p>In Hungary, a huge amount of bills are paid through yellow checks at post offices every year while the online payment is also there. There isn't any aggregator application on the market. Service providers could use their own channel, but it would have maintenance and development costs while the customers would see different user interfaces all the time when they pay their bills to each provider. This would reduce the customer experience as a whole.</p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>

                <p>Mastercard builds on the existing Bill Pay Exchange and releases Billpay. The application is available to all the service providers in Hungary to reach their customer base. The customers can pay their bills through the mobile application which also provides the possibility of recurring payments with debit card or bank account.</p>

                <p>People who want to keep all their payments in one place. However, many of them do not trust banks enough to stop using yellow checks.</p>

                <p>Based on the brief given by UI Academy, I created a persona who has the same characteristics.</p>

                <h3>Design: Concepts</h3>

                <p>My main goal with the design was to leave the user in the comfort zone. Since this group is not the most familiar with modern technology and their trust in banks are very uncertain, I wanted to create a simple and clear user interface with a few but necessary colors that keep them focused.</p>

                <h3>Design System</h3>

                <p>The interface was designed based on the official Mastercard design book. Mastercard has a well-known trademark and I wanted to make a design which is loyal to the brand, that's why orange was chosen as the primary color which represents the brand pretty well, so do the inputs, checkboxes and buttons with rounded corners.</p>
    
                <h4>Style Guide</h4>
    
                Mark Pro is the official font for the Mastercard digital products.
