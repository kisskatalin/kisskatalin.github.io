                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">To make the business processes faster by less complicated and more logical interfaces.</p> 

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">My main project at Matusz-Vad Zrt. was to redesign the Java-based ERP system to a web structure. Every department of the company, from warehouse to sales, uses the ERP, so all processes are integrated into one place. I wanted to keep this control and the basics of the system in the new design while removing all redundancy, merging identical processes to reduce the huge number of modules and creating a user-friendly and responsive interface.</p>

However, I had to eliminate pieces that didn't fit into the flow (e.g. an active <i>Save</i> button when the user hasn't interacted with the interface yet).</p>

                            <p class="projectsSectionText">In the old system, there were two types of error messages: one in a pop-up window, two on the left bottom which appeared when the user didn't fill out an input field correctly. In my solution, a window popped up when the system asks for save before leaving, and a message shown on the bottom when there is a success/warning/informational/error.</p>

                            <p class="projectsSectionText">The users liked to bookmark modules to reach them easier, so I moved that function into the new design with improvement. In the old system, before opening it, you had to right click onto the title of the module to add it to the favorites, but it was unable to remove due to lack of programming. In the new one, you click on the icon next to the title and the module is added to the bookmarks without leaving </p>
