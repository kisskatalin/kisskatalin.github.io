                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">To make the business processes faster by less complicated and more logical interfaces.</p> 

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">My main project at Matusz-Vad Zrt. was to redesign the Java-based ERP system to a web structure. Every department of the company, from warehouse to sales, uses the ERP, so all processes are integrated into one place. <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">The company employees are familiar with how the system works functionally</span>, as most of them use it for years every day, so <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">I wanted to keep the basics of the system</span> while improving the entire architecture with better user experience.

                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">The Java-based ERP was functionally confusing, slow in performance and looked very outdated.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">I worked with SQL developers, employees and managers.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">I visited the departments and spent 30+ hours with the employees. Mostly, I worked the night shift at the warehouse in Győr as I started the design with the night warehouse processes. <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">I watched the employees and tried to understand what they do, and how the real-life results get added to the ERP system.</span></p>
                        
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">As I kept asking them about the system, the employees complained about the lack of multitasking capability, the difficulty of searching and useless functions. Other problems I noticed were loading slowness, incorrect button and label titles, spelling mistakes, confusing error messages, fonts and colors.</p>
                        
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">To get to know the departments better and what the users need, I created flows of the work process, so I could see where the work is very intensive as I was able to match the (sub)modules to each point.</p>

                    <h3>Insight</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">Lack of dynamics causes less smooth user flows and results in complications.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText"><span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">A web application with Angular can be more dynamic than a Java-based static one.</span> There were separate (sub)modules based on permission in the old system which meant a certain task could have up to three windows, e.g. waybills had one for view, one for data entry and one for printing. This is very confusing because the users can't be sure which one they need to open.</p>
                    
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Usually, the buttons were still active on the interface when they couldn't have been used, e.g. the <span style="font-style: italic;">Save</span> button remains clickable when none changes are made or the mandatory fields aren't filled out. This doesn't avoid pointless actions which overload the system with error messages and make the user experience inconsistent.</p>
                    
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">The design elements needed to be fixed also. The layout wasn't arranged by a grid system, not to mention its design system which was chaotic with disturbingly colorful fields and conceptless key combinations.</p>

                    <h3>High-Fidelity Wireframe</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">Some of over 200 wireframes that I made are highlighted. I led 5 usability testing sessions to see if everything met the criteria. I created a design system with over 70 components.</p>

                        <pc lass="projectsSectionText">There are 13 main modules: warehouse, production, logistics, international cooperation, supply, business transactions, telesales, controlling, finance, marketing, human resources, stocks, fixed assets. I redesigned over 50 (sub)modules within them.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText"><span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">I removed all redundancy, merged identical processes to decrease the huge number of (sub)modules</span> and created a user-friendly and responsive interface.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">In the old ERP system, <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">searching in tables was not clear</span>. Users had to click onto the cell, press <span style="font-style: italic;">F4</span>, press <span style="font-style: italic;">Backspace</span> and write the word between <span style="font-style: italic;">%%</span> and press <span style="font-style: italic;">F8</span> to see the results. In my design, they can do it with one step by typing the words into the search field.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Tables with long rows are very common in the system which causes problems with the data entry. In the old system, the width of the columns was small, therefore the column titles had to be short. Now, the titles are written correctly, however, I couldn't avoid the huge length of the tables, so users have to scroll horizontally to see the last column. To make it easier, <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">clicking the row opens a pop-up window to check out the fields</span>.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">The yellow input fields were actually dropdowns with pop-up that contained a search input that could be opened with <span style="font-style: italic;">F9</span> on Windows, the combination of <span style="font-style: italic;">fn</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">F9</span> on Mac.

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">It was also desired <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">to hide columns from long tables</span>, so the necessary data could be filtered out. It's important when the same (sub)modules are used by different departments, but every department needs different data for their work.</p>

                    <h3>Impact Overview</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="projectsSectionSummary">Matusz-Vad Zrt. is one of the most valuable food sales companies with nearly 2,000 types of products from 4 continents and 10,000 active partners in Hungary, with two offices and three warehouses which requires fast and coordinated work between the places.</p>
                        
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">That's why <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">an integrated ERP system increases efficiency in every way which saves time and money for the company</span>. First of all, the system is on the web now, available from anywhere on any device. Which is very important for senior managers, salespersons and forwarding agents who are usually away from the office.</p>
                    
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Since the modules for production were launched, work processes have become faster thanks to digitization. Previously, the employees filled out the production logs on paper, but now, all the data can be stored in the ERP system.</p>
                    
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Also, back then, they had to open several windows at the same time and wait 2-3 minutes to complete tasks which meant the server was under load. However, in the new ERP system, <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextBold', sans-serif;">they can do it in less than 1 minute (faster by 56%)</span> as the user flows have gotten shortened.</p>
                    
                        <p class="projectsSectionText">To me, working with the company employees was very effective. It was good to understand what they use which helped me to design the new ERP system and appreciated all the feedback that came from them.</p>
