                        <p class="projectsSectionText">My <span class="textBold">research questions</span> I was searching for participants with:</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">I interviewed users about which type of clothes they buy.</p>

                            <li>What type of clothes do you buy online? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do they buy jeans?)</span></li>
                            <li>Where do you buy clothes online? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which stores are they satisfied with?)</span></li>
                            <li>Have you ever had a size that wasn't fitting? Did you return it? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do they use this service?)</span></li>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Before I started designing, I visited three fashion websites to check out what logic and interface they serve when they sell jeans. By reviewing them, it's not hard to see why the users are not confident about buying jeans.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">AG Jeans displays many photos on their product page which is positive. But we have to scroll down under the photos to read the details. While scrolling down, the left side of the page is fixed which is not the best way because if we read the details and click for the color of the jeans at the same time, we don't see the change unless we scroll up to the photos.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText">Just Jeans also uses many photos. But the product description doesn't use measures because they're hidden under a "Size Guide" link where the photos are not shown. Also, the header of the website is too height, takes up more space than it should while the product page feels crowded with many photos, texts and offers.</p>

                        <p class="projectsSectionText"> Mother Denim has the most professional interface of them all. They use a video of the model going around in the jeans. Also, as we scroll down, the info stays fixed which is a very good solution. However, the information could be more detailed. Especially, we have to open tabs to see the details.</p>

Where she lives, she doesn't find the right clothes for herself often, so she looks for them online. She prefers shopping at an actual store because that's where she can try on the pieces, but if she finds something online that she really likes, she orders it.
