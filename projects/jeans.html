            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

            <p>Shopping for jeans and other form-fitting apparel online could be time-consuming and frustrating. It's hard to compare between different styles, and it's hard to know for sure how they will fit. It's a disappointing experience when you have to return an item that doesn't fit quite right. How can you help customers select the style of jeans that they’re looking for in the right size?</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>

            <p>I wanted to learn about what the customers buy at fashion stores online.</p>

            <h4>Research questions</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they buy clothes online?</li>
                <li>Do they buy jeans online?</li>
                <li>How satisfied are they while browsing the selection of jeans?</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

            <h5>Participants</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Users who buy clothes often but are afraid to buy jeans</li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">5 participants</span> were interviewed about which type of clothes they buy and where.

            <h5>In-person semi-structured interview questions</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>How often do you buy clothes online? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Are they experienced customers?)</i></li>
                <li>Do you buy clothes in stores or online more often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do they trust in online stores?)</span></li>
                <li>When you buy something online, why do you prefer that way? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What motivates them to shop?)</span></li>
                <li>What type of clothes do you buy online? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do they buy jeans?)</span></li>
                <li>Where do you buy clothes online? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which stores are they satisfied with?)</span></li>
                <li>Have you ever had a size that wasn't good? Did you return it? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Did they use this service?)</span></li>
            </ol>

            <p>All the info given helped me to create a better customer experience.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <h4>Key Findings</h4>

            <ol type="A">
                <li><p>None of the participants buy jeans online</p>
                        <p>They find it risky.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"It's hard to guess if it fits ot not."</span>
                            <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I buy everything but pants."</span>
                        </p>
                </li>
                    <li>1 out of 5 participants shop more often online than at a store
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">"The store is far away. I usually find the cloth cheaper online."</span>
                            <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"In terms of buying clothes, stores are better."</span>
                        </p>
                </li>

                <li>None of the participants return their non-fitting clothes
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">"I always order from the same places, so I know my sizes already. If it doesn't fit, I rather sell it."</span>
                            <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"If they don't fit, I give them to my friends."</span>
                        </p>
                </li>
            </ol> 

            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>

            <p>Before I started designing, I visited three fashion websites to check out what logic and interface they provide when they sale jeans.</p>

            <figure class="projects_pic projects_pic2">
                <img src="../pic/jeans/competition.png">
                <figcaption>AG Jeans / Mother Denim / Just Jeans</figcaption>
            </figure>

            Mother Denim has the most professional interface of them all. They use a video of the model going around in the jeans that confirms the customer's decision. However, the information on the jeans could be more detailed.
