            Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

            <p>The Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to their website.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>

            <p>The upgraded design of the Last.fm mobile application has the same features that are only available on the website now. Compared to the website, the redesigned mobile application is easier to use as it contains all the important functions that were missing while the interface got less complex.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>

    I wanted to learn about how the users use the current mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between it and the website.

    <h4>Research questions</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Do they use Last.fm frequently?</li>
        <li>Do they use Last.fm for a long time?</li>
        <li>How do they use the current mobile application?</li>
        <li>How satisfied are they while using the current mobile application?</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

    <h5>Participants</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Users who use Last.fm for years</li>
        <li>Users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight: 400;">6 participants</span> were interviewed about what they use and what they like or dislike about the current mobile application.
    <br>
    <br>
    In-person semi-structured interview questions:

    <ol>
        <li>Which services do you use to scrobble music? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which services are the users comfortable with?)</i></li>
        <li>How do you decide what to listen to? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Where do they discover music?)</span></li>
        <li>Why did you get started using Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What motivated them to sign up?)</span></li>
        <li>When was the last time you opened up Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do the users use Last.fm?)</span></li>
        <li>Do you use the mobile application or the website more often? Why? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do the users prefer the mobile application or the website of Last.fm?)</span></li>
        <li>How often do you check out the reports/statistics of your listening history? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do they use this feature?)</span></li>
        <li>Which timeframe do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
        <li>Which section do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
        <li>Besides checking out your scrobbles, do you use Last.fm for anything else (e.g. for discovering new music, checking out events, visiting the artists' pages, etc.)? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which features do they use?)</span></li>
        <li>What do you like about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the strength of the mobile application?)</span></li>
        <li>What do you dislike about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the weakness of the mobile application?)</span></li>
        <li>If you were to add something to Last.fm, what will it be? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What are their wishes from the mobile application?)</span></li>
    </ol>

    After the user interviews, I expanded the research by sending out a survey among the Last.fm users.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">69 participants</span> filled out a survey about what they use on Last.fm. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Survey questions:
    <ol>
        <li>How long have you been using Last.fm?</li>
        <li>How often do you visit Last.fm?</li>
        <li>Which timeframe on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
        <li>Which section on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
        <li>Did you upgrade to Last.fm Pro?</li>
        <li>Besides scrobbling your tracks, which of the following features do you use on Last.fm?</li>
        <li>Do you use the Last.fm application on your mobile?</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>

                <caption>Affinity map from the user research</caption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Key findings based on the users' needs:</h4>

            <p>1) The participants prefer the website over the mobile application</p>
            They find the mobile application limited compared to the website.
            <br>“I miss the edit function for the scrobbles, so I still have to go the website if i want to change some tags.”
            <br>“I miss a better and longer overview of the listening history.”
            <br>“The settings are very limited. It literally just gives you the option to turn off scrobbling.”

            <p>2) Some participants are curious about what others are listening to</p>
            “I want to see what the friends listen to.”
            <br>“I listen to music what I like and what others enjoy.”
            <br>“On the website, I like to check out other members' profiles.”

            <p>3) The 30% of the participants are Last.fm Pro members</p>

            <h4>Key findings based on the users' behaviors:</h4>

            <p>4) Just a few of them use the mobile application more often than the website.</p>
            “I use the mobile app on daily basis, the website on weekly basis. The app is just a tap away, so I open it when I'm bored.”
            <br>“I use the website because I can get better info on it.”
            <br>“I check out the website on daily basis. I don't find the mobile app useable.”

            <p>5) The participants checks out the reports/statistics on daily or weekly basis.</p>
            “I use the app on daily basis and check out the weekly reports.”
            <br>“I used to check the reports weekly before, but now I just wait for their message monthly.”

            <p>6) Just a few of them check out what Last.fm offers them as recommendation. They use other products for it.</p>

            <p>7) None of the participants communicate with other members by sending messages to them via the inbox or on their profiles.</p>

                <caption>Themes and opportunities based on the user interviews</caption>

            <h4>Research finding applied to the design</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Since the participants totally skip the index page with the recommendations on the website, the new index page is their scrobbles.</li>
                <li>The users can edit their scrobbles.</li>
                <li>Recommendations are moved to another page.</li>
                <li>The message function is entirely removed.</li>
            </ul>

    <p>You can sign up with social media accounts too, so you don't have to spend their times to fill out all the input fields.</p>

    <figure class="projects_pic">
        <img src="../pic/lastfm_3.png">
        <caption>Scrobbles</caption>
    </figure>

    <p>The home screen displays the listening history, including the latest scrobbles and lists set by timeframes. The menu is also available here with the current listening activity from friends.</p>

    <p>Unlike the website, the songs on this application aren't moved to singles pages because they open up in overlay. You can see detailed info on the songs and find all your scrobbles in a scrolling list.</p>
