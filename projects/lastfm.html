            Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

            <p>The Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to their website.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>

            <p>The upgraded design of the Last.fm mobile application has the same features that are only available on the website now. Compared to the website, the redesigned mobile application is easier to use as it contains all the important functions that were missing while the interface got less complex.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>

            <p>I wanted to learn about how the users use the current mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between it and the website.</p>

            <h4>Research questions</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Do they use Last.fm frequently?</li>
                <li>Do they use Last.fm for a long time?</li>
                <li>How do they use the current mobile application?</li>
                <li>How satisfied are they while using the current mobile application?</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>User Research Plan</h4>

            <h5>Participants</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>Users who use Last.fm for years</li>
                <li>Users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">6 participants</span> were interviewed about what they use and what they like or dislike about the current mobile application.

            <h5>In-person semi-structured interview questions</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>Which services do you use to scrobble music? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which services are the users comfortable with?)</i></li>
                <li>How do you decide what to listen to? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Where do they discover music?)</span></li>
                <li>Why did you get started using Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What motivated them to sign up?)</span></li>
                <li>When was the last time you opened up Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do the users use Last.fm?)</span></li>
                <li>Do you use the mobile application or the website more often? Why? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do the users prefer the mobile application or the website of Last.fm?)</span></li>
                <li>How often do you check out the reports/statistics of your listening history? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do they use this feature?)</span></li>
                <li>Which timeframe do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
                <li>Which section do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
                <li>Besides checking out your scrobbles, do you use Last.fm for anything else (e.g. for discovering new music, checking out events, visiting the artists' pages, etc.)? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which features do they use?)</span></li>
                <li>What do you like about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the strength of the mobile application?)</span></li>
                <li>What do you dislike about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the weakness of the mobile application?)</span></li>
                <li>If you were to add something to Last.fm, what will it be? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What are their wishes from the mobile application?)</span></li>
            </ol>

            <p>After the user interviews, I expanded the research by sending out a survey among the Last.fm users.</p>
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">69 participants</span> filled out a survey about what they use on Last.fm.</p>

            <h5>Survey questions</h5>

            <ol>
                <li>How long have you been using Last.fm?</li>
                <li>How often do you visit Last.fm?</li>
                <li>Which timeframe on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
                <li>Which section on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
                <li>Did you upgrade to Last.fm Pro?</li>
                <li>Besides scrobbling your tracks, which of the following features do you use on Last.fm?</li>
                <li>Do you use the Last.fm application on your mobile?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Some participants are curious about what others are listening to

            <ol type="A">
                <li>Just a few of them use the mobile application more often than the website.

                        <span style="font-style: italic;">"I use the app on daily basis and check out the weekly reports."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I used to check the reports weekly before, but now I just wait for their message monthly."</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Just a few of them check out what Last.fm offers them as recommendation because they use other products for it</li>

                <li>None of the participants communicate with other members by sending messages to them via the inbox or on their profiles</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Key findings based on other:</h4>

            <p>Years ago, Last.fm stopped its music service in the middle of the rising of the screaming era and replaced it with YouTube. It's not hard to see why. New competitions entered the market with better deals that Last.fm couldn't longer compete with. Because of this, they focus on data collection and storage based on the user's listening that is a unique feature by them. Since the music listening is provided by a third-party service via Last.fm which is not available everywhere on the website, the user rather uses another product for that and redirects the listening data to Last.fm. While using the other product, the user meets information and doesn't use Last.fm to discover new music. However, Last.fm can easily identify the trend among the users by creating weekly, monthly and yearly reports, even live charts based on the collected data received from several music services. This is very effective, but unfortunately, it's not developed enough on the website and not too many users are interested in it.</p>

            <h3>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h3>

            <p>Based on the user interviews, I categorized the remarks into themes. Given the survey results as well, I took the opportunities and turned them into possible features. After that, to see how important they are compared to each other, I put them into a coordinate system with X represeting value while Y representing complexity.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Research finding applied to the design</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Since the participants totally skip the index page with the recommendations on the website, the new index page is their scrobbles.</li>
                <li>The users can edit their scrobbles. <span style="font-style: italic;">(With high value and low complexity, it's the most important feature right now.)</span></li>
                <li>Recommendations are moved to another page. <span style="font-style: italic;">(With low value and low complexity, it's the least necessary feature right now.)</span></li>
                <li>The message function is entirely removed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the middle of the coordinate system, there is a feature which is new and we don't know how hard it would be implemented.</p>

            <h4>Sketch</h4>

            <p>Based on findings, I drew up my ideas on paper. First of all, I sketched eight ideas that first came to my mind. These were only components or a small part of my ideal application. Then I sketched a more detailed version which led me into create the low-fidelity wireframe.</p>

            <p>The home screen displays the listening history, including the latest scrobbles and lists set by timeframes. The menu is also available here with the current listening activity from friends.</p>

            <h4>Artists and albums</h4>

            <figure class="projects_pic">

            <p></p>

            <h4>Songs</h4>

            <figure class="projects_pic">
                <img src="../pic/lastfm_5.png">
                <caption>Songs</caption>
            </figure>

            <p>Unlike the website, the songs on this application aren't moved to singles pages because they open up in overlay instead. You can see detailed info on the songs and find all your scrobbles in a scrolling list where you can edit them one by one.</p>
        
            <h4>Overview</h4>

            <p>While designing the interface, I tested both the low-fidelity wireframe and high-fidelity prototype with three types of users:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>People who never used Last.fm before</li>
                <li>Last.fm users who don't use the mobile application but use the website</li>
                <li>Last.fm users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
            </ul>

            <p>New users found it easy to use because it looks simple with good contrast. While website-only users had the same opinion, they welcomed the solution to keep it similar to the website but in a upgraded version. The most of them would download it to their phones. Both website-only users and app users liked the idea of songs not having singles pages.</p>

            <p>The users felt frustrated because you couldn't edit their own data. Data belongs to a user and if they can't edit it.</p>

            <h3>Suggestion for further</h3>

            <p>My research didn't establish other options that could imply new features in the mobile application. One of these could be adding scrobbles manually. In the recent years, vinyl sales have been increasing, so the user doesn't necessarily listen to music digitally anymore, therefore Last.fm doesn't fully represents the user's taste. During my user interviews, this case was just partly talked, but this could be the subject of a conversation in the future. Right now, we don't see how useful it could be for the users and how difficult and expensive it would be to create it on the application.</p>
