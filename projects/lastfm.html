            Last.fm is a website that provides you to scrobble songs from online music services (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) where you listen to music. Last.fm creates recommendations, reports and statistics based on your listening history. You can love your favorite tracks, view statistics of your personal songs, artists, albums.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">The current Last.fm mobile application has limited features and often navigates the users to their website. The users feel frustrated because they always have to open the browser to log in their accounts to delete their scrobbles, check out the pages of artists, songs, etc.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <div>
            The upgraded design of the Last.fm mobile application has the same features that are only available on the website now. Compared to the website, the redesigned mobile application is easier to use as it contains all the important functions that were missing while the interface got less complex.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <div>
            I wanted to learn about how the users use the current mobile application and find out how they feel about the difference between it and the website.

            <br><br>My <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">research questions</span> with which I was searching for test users:

            <ul>
                <li>Do they use Last.fm frequently?</li>
                <li>Do they use Last.fm for a long time?</li>
                <li>How do they use the current mobile application?</li>
                <li>How satisfied are they while using the current mobile application?</li>
            </ul>

            I interviewed 6 users about what they use and what they like or dislike about the current mobile application.

            <p>My in-person semi-structured <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">interview questions:</span></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Which services do you use to scrobble music? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which services are the users comfortable with?)</i></li>
                <li>How do you decide what to listen to? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Where do they discover music?)</span></li>
                <li>Why did you get started using Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What motivated them to sign up?)</span></li>
                <li>When was the last time you opened up Last.fm? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do the users use Last.fm?)</span></li>
                <li>Do you use the mobile application or the website more often? Why? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Do the users prefer the mobile application or the website of Last.fm?)</span></li>
                <li>How often do you check out the reports/statistics of your listening history? <span style="font-style: italic;">(How often do they use this feature?)</span></li>
                <li>Which timeframe do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
                <li>Which section do you check out the most often? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which of the data from their listening history do they like to see?)</span></li>
                <li>Besides checking out your scrobbles, do you use Last.fm for anything else (e.g. for discovering new music, checking out events, visiting the artists' pages, etc.)? <span style="font-style: italic;">(Which features do they use?)</span></li>
                <li>What do you like about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the strength of the mobile application?)</span></li>
                <li>What do you dislike about the mobile application? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What is the weakness of the mobile application?)</span></li>
                <li>If you were to add something to Last.fm, what will it be? <span style="font-style: italic;">(What are their wishes from the mobile application?)</span></li>
            </ol>

            <p>After the user interviews, I expanded the research by sending out a survey. 69 users filled out my survey about what they use on Last.fm.</p>

            <p>My <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">survey questions</span>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How long have you been using Last.fm?</li>
                <li>How often do you visit Last.fm?</li>
                <li>Which timeframe on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
                <li>Which section on your Last.fm profile do you check out the most often?</li>
                <li>Did you upgrade to Last.fm Pro?</li>
                <li>Besides scrobbling your tracks, which of the following features do you use on Last.fm?</li>
                <li>Do you use the Last.fm application on your mobile?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>All the info given helped me to fix and improve the mobile application.</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">From the interviews, I created an <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">affinity map</span> with quotes from the users and categorized them.</p>
            <figure style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                <img src="../pic/lastfm/affinitymap.jpg">
            </figure>

            <p>My <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">key findings</span> based on the research:</p>

            <ol type="A">
                <li>The participants prefer the website over the mobile application
                        <p>They find the mobile application limited compared to the website.</p>
                        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"I miss the edit function for the scrobbles, so I still have to go the website if i want to change some tags."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I miss a better and longer overview of the listening history."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The settings are very limited. It literally just gives you the option to turn off scrobbling."</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Some participants are curious about what others are listening to
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-style: italic;">"I want to see what the friends listen to."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I listen to music what I like and what others enjoy."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"On the website, I like to check out other members' profiles."</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>The 30% of the participants are Last.fm Pro members</li>

                <li>Just a few of them use the mobile application more often than the website.
                        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"I use the mobile app on daily basis, the website on weekly basis. The app is just a tap away, so I open it when I'm bored."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I use the website because I can get better info on it."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I check out the website on daily basis. I don't find the mobile app useable."</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>The participants checks out the reports/statistics on daily or weekly basis
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-style: italic;">"I use the app on daily basis and check out the weekly reports."</span>
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I used to check the reports weekly before, but now I just wait for their message monthly."</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Just a few of them check out what Last.fm offers them as recommendation because they use other products for it</li>

                <li>None of the participants communicate with other members by sending messages to them via the inbox or on their profiles</li>
            </ol>

            <p><span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">Another finding</span> that is not fitting into the user's needs, nor behavior, but it's interesting to mention:</p>

            <p>Years ago, Last.fm stopped its music service in the middle of the rising of the screaming era and replaced it with YouTube. It's not hard to see why. New competitions entered the market with better deals that Last.fm couldn't longer compete with. Because of this, they focus on data collection and storage based on the user's listening that is a unique feature by them. Since the music listening is provided by a third-party service via Last.fm which is not available everywhere on the website, the user rather uses another product for that and redirects the listening data to Last.fm. While using the other product, the user meets information and doesn't use Last.fm to discover new music. However, Last.fm can easily identify the trend among the users by creating weekly, monthly and yearly reports, even live charts based on the collected data received from several music services. This is very effective, but unfortunately, it's not developed enough on the website and not too many users are interested in it.</p>

        <h3>Concepts</h3>
        <div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Based on the user interviews and given the survey results as well, similar to the affinity map, I categorized the remarks into <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">themes</span> to see what <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">opportunities</span> the new app can have and turned them into possible features.</p>
            <figure style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                <img src="../pic/lastfm/themesandopportunities.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">After that, to see how important they are compared to each other, I put them into a coordinate system with X represeting value while Y representing complexity.</p>
            
            <figure style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                <img src="../pic/lastfm/featureprioritization.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>By this graphic, it was easy to see which features are worth dealing with.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since the participants totally skip the index page with the recommendations on the website, the new index page is their scrobbles.</li>
                <li>The users can edit their scrobbles. <span style="font-style: italic;">(With high value and low complexity, it's the most important feature right now.)</span></li>
                <li>Recommendations are moved to another page. <span style="font-style: italic;">(With low value and low complexity, it's the least necessary feature right now.)</span></li>
                <li>The message function is entirely removed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the middle of the coordinate system, there is a feature which is new and we don't know how hard it would be implemented.</p>

        <h3>Sketch & Low-fidelity wireframe</h3>
        <div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">I drew up my ideas on paper. First of all, I sketched <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">eight ideas</span> that first came to my mind. These were only components or a small part of my ideal application. Then I sketched <span style="font-family: 'SpaceTextMedium'; border-bottom: 2px solid #2f2f2f; padding-bottom: 2px;">a more detailed version</span> which led me into create the low-fidelity wireframe.</p>

            <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 1fr); grid-column-gap: 12px; margin-bottom: 32px;">

        <h3>High-fidelity wireframe</h3>
        <div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">After picking the correct fonts, colors and icons, I transformed the lo-fi wireframe into a hi-fi wireframe. I started it with the log in and sign up screens and continued with the user profile which is also the home screen with the most functions on the app.</p>

        <h3>Impact overview</h3>
        <div>
            <p>While designing the interface, I tested both the low-fidelity wireframe and high-fidelity prototype with three types of users:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>People who never used Last.fm before</li>
                <li>Last.fm users who don't use the mobile application but use the website</li>
                <li>Last.fm users who have used/are currently using the Last.fm mobile application</li>
            </ul>

            <p>New users found it easy and logical to use because it looks simple with good contrast. While website-only users had the same opinion, plus, they welcomed the solution to keep it similar to the website but in a upgraded version. The most of them would download it to their phones. Both website-only users and app users liked the idea of songs not having singles pages but going up in overlays.</p>

            <p>My research didn't cover other options that could imply new features in the mobile application. One of these could be adding scrobbles manually. In the recent years, vinyl sales have been increasing, so the user doesn't necessarily listen to music digitally anymore, therefore Last.fm doesn't fully represents the user's taste. During my user interviews, this case was just briefly discussed, so this could be the subject of a conversation in the future. Right now, we don't see how useful it could be for the users and how difficult and expensive it would be implemented.</p>
            
            <p>What I learned while redesigning this application is that the users are not happy when they can't handle their own data which belongs to them. The lack of functions led to frustration and dissatisfaction which could have hurt the brand if they weren't in a somewhat monopoly position.</p>
